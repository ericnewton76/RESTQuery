# Overview
This library makes it easy to try to standardize REST server side filtering, sorting, and paging.

- Paging is handled by querystring fields 'start' and 'rows'
- Sorting is handled by querystring field 'sort'
- Filtering is the rest of the querystring fields, `price[lte]=3&price[gt]=0&desc~=the` which would filter for `0 > price >= 3 AND desc contains 'the'`  see also:
